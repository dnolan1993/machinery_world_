</ul>

### Images
<ul>
    <li>
    All images throughout the site are of construction machinery, as it is a construction equipment based theme park. I tried to us the most eye catching pictures I could find of the machinery that would best display how the machinery operated and to catch the eye of the user.
    </li>
</ul>

### Colour Scheme
<ul>
    <li>
    For the colours of the webpage I went with a dark background and a light text colour as I felt this woould stand out to the user and as most of the images had a lighter back ground, they would stand out more to the user.
    </li>
</ul>

### Fonts

<ul>
    <li>
    For the fonts I used Google fonts. For the logo I used 'Stalinist One' as it is a big blocky font that I felt would fit well with the type of logo I wanted for the website, all other text on the site is 'Roboto' as I felt it flowed well throughout the site and is very readable for a user. 
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        I tested that the site works on differrnt browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari (on iPhone).
    </li>
    <li>
        I used devtools to ensure my webpage was responsive across varying screen sizes and devices. I also used devtools to ensure the site functioned in the manner I intended.
    </li>
    <li>
        I tested all links to ensure that they bring the user to the intended page and/or section of the page.
    </li>
    <li>
        I confirmed that all content of the pages were easy to read and understand for the user, with clear headings to signal to the user where the content was and what it related to.
    </li>
    <li>
        I confirmed my form functionality by running it with the correct information, then incorrect information as a control to ensure the inputs were correct and working corrrectly.
    </li>
</ul>

## Bugs
### Solved bugs
<ul>
    <li>
    When I tested the "Book Now!" form page I relised that if you use auto-fill on google chrome browsers it changed the background color of the text inputs to white, which caused an issue as the text color is also white making it invisible within the text input.
    </li>
    <li>
    I researched online to find that this is a common problem, I found an article on stackoverflow.com giving code examples to correct this error but because my text inputs are transparent I had to continue to run different variants of similar code until I found one that fixed the error. 
    </li>
    <li>
    Adding the code snipet:<br>
        transition: background-color 5000s ease-in-out 0s;<br>
    Solved the problem and the form page functioned properly again.
    </li>
</ul>
