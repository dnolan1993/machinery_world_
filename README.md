### Images
<ul>
    <li>
    All images throughout the site are of construction machinery, as it is a construction equipment based theme park. I tried to us the most eye catching pictures I could find of the machinery that would best display how the machinery operated and to catch the eye of the user.
    </li>
</ul>

### Colour Scheme
<ul>
    <li>
    For the colours of the webpage I went with a dark background and a light text colour as I felt this woould stand out to the user and as most of the images had a lighter back ground, they would stand out more to the user.
    </li>
</ul>

### Fonts

<ul>
    <li>
    For the fonts I used Google fonts. For the logo I used 'Stalinist One' as it is a big blocky font that I felt would fit well with the type of logo I wanted for the website, all other text on the site is 'Roboto' as I felt it flowed well throughout the site and is very readable for a user. 
    </li>
</ul>
