The Machinery World website is a site to advertise a fictional constructioin machinery theme park. Machinery world is a theme park where ,kids age 8 and over , and adults can experience driving any construction equipment they choose. To get a feel for what it's like to run machinery first hand.

<br>

### Images
<ul>
    <li>
    All images throughout the site are of construction machinery, as it is a construction equipment based theme park. I tried to us the most eye catching pictures I could find of the machinery that would best display how the machinery operated and to catch the eye of the user.
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

### Colour Scheme
<ul>
    <li>
    For the colours of the webpage I went with a dark background and a light text colour as I felt this woould stand out to the user and as most of the images had a lighter back ground, they would stand out more to the user.
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

### Fonts

<ul>
    <li>
    For the fonts I used Google fonts. For the logo I used 'Stalinist One' as it is a big blocky font that I felt would fit well with the type of logo I wanted for the website, all other text on the site is 'Roboto' as I felt it flowed well throughout the site and is very readable for a user. 
    </li>
</ul>

## Bugs
### Solved bugs

My mentor pointed out that on smaller screen sizes my website was creating a horizontal scroll, which I had not intended and was not ideal for the page layout.

We determined this horizontal scroll was created by an logo overflowing out of its parent element.

to solve this I reduced the font size for the logo in a media query for smaller device screen sizes.

This fixed the problem and now the site functions as intended on all screen sizes.

### Unsolved bugs

To my knowledge, there are no unsolved bugs within the site.

## Deployment
This site is hosted by GitHub pages, deployed directly to the master branch. The deployed site will update if after new commits are made, they are pushed to GitHub pages using the "git push" command in the terminal. The Homepage is named index.html to ensure it deploys correctly through GitHib pages.

To deploy the site to GitHub pages I took the following steps:
<ol>
    <li>
        I logged in to Github.
    </li>
    <li>
        I selected "dnolan1993/machinery_world_" from my repositories.
    </li>
    <li>
        I selected "Settings", to the right hand side of the nav bar.
    </li>
    <li>
        I selected "Pages", lower left on the screen.
    </li>
    <li>
        I selected "Main" in the branch dropdown menu, within the "Source" section.
    </li>
    <li>
        I refreshed my page using "ctrl+shift+r" to perform a hard reload of the GitHub web page.
    </li>
    <li>
        GitHib pages then display a page with a banner stating "Your site is published at https://dnolan1993.github.io/machinery_world_/"
